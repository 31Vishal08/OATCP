This C++ code aims to find a valid arrangement of pairs of integers in a given input. Here's an explanation of the approach:

Headers and Macros:
The code includes the <bits/stdc++.h> header, which includes most standard C++ headers.
It defines macros for long long and a modulo value.
Function getsrc:
This function takes an unordered map deg as input, which contains pairs of integers indicating the in-degree and out-degree of each node.
It iterates through the deg map to find a node whose in-degree is one less than its out-degree. It returns the index of such a node as the source.
Function validArrangement:
This function takes a vector of pairs pairs as input, where each pair represents a directed edge in a graph.
It initializes an unordered map graph to represent the adjacency list of the graph and another unordered map deg to store the in-degree and out-degree of each node.
It iterates through each pair in pairs:
Inserts the destination of each pair into the adjacency list of the source node in graph.
Updates the in-degree and out-degree of the destination and source nodes in the deg map.
It finds the source node using the getsrc function.
It initializes a deque path and a stack st.
It starts with the source node src and performs a modified depth-first search (DFS) traversal:
If the current node has no outgoing edges, it adds the node to the front of the path deque and pops it from the stack.
Otherwise, it selects an outgoing edge from the current node, removes it from the graph, and pushes the destination node onto the stack.
After the traversal, it constructs the answer by forming pairs of consecutive nodes in the path.
Finally, it returns the answer.
Main Function:
Reads the number of pairs n from the input.
Reads each pair of integers into the vector vp.
Calls the validArrangement function with the input vector vp.
If a valid arrangement is found, it prints each pair. Otherwise, it prints "No valid arrangement found!"
Time Complexity:
Constructing the adjacency list and updating the in-degree and out-degree of each node takes O(n) time, where n is the number of pairs.
The modified DFS traversal takes O(n) time.
Constructing the answer takes O(n) time.
Overall, the time complexity is O(n).
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the adjacency list (graph), in-degree and out-degree map (deg), stack (st), and deque (path).
