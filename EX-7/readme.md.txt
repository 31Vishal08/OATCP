
APPROACH:


Here we just converted each number to string and placed them in a vector and sorted that vector by implementing custom comparator
in which we can check by concatinating two strings(numbers ) which one gives larger number and after that we can form the ans 
just by concatinating all of these numbers into a single string we have used flag here to handle the case when there are 0's 
only in that case we have to return just a single o in output.
