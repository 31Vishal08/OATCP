APPROACH: 

-> The problem requires us to minimize the resulting number by removing k digits from the given number num.

-> A greedy approach is suitable because at each step (processing each digit), we make a locally optimal choice (keeping the smallest possible digit) with the aim of achieving the overall optimal solution (smallest resulting number).

-> By prioritizing smaller digits for the most significant places, we ensure that the resulting number is minimized.
