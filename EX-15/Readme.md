This code generates all unique combinations of given strings of varying lengths and prints them to an output file. Here's an explanation of the algorithm and its components:

->Key Components

1. Function to Generate Combinations
   - The function `generateCombinations` takes four parameters: `input` (the input string), `current` (the current combination being built), `index` (the current index in the input string), and `length` (the target length of the combination).
   - The function is recursive, creating all possible combinations from the input string with a given length.

2. Reading Input
   - The main function reads an integer `numStrings` to determine how many strings will be processed.
   - It reads each string from input and stores them in a `vector<vector<string>>` called `allCombinations`.

3. Generating Unique Combinations
   - For each input string, the code generates all combinations of lengths 1 through 4.
   - It uses a `set` (`uniqueCombinations`) to ensure combinations are unique.
   - If a generated combination is not in the set, it is added to the current list of combinations (`currentCombinations`) and to the set to avoid duplicates.

4. Outputting the Combinations
   - After generating all unique combinations for all input strings, the code iterates over `allCombinations` and prints each combination to an output file.

->Recursive Combination Generation
- The recursive function `generateCombinations` has two base cases:
  - If `length` is zero, the current combination is added to `combinations`.
  - If `index` exceeds the length of `input`, recursion stops and an empty `combinations` is returned.
- The recursive step has two parts:
  - **With Character**: It adds the character at `index` to `current` and calls itself with `index + 1` and `length - 1`.
  - **Without Character**: It skips the character at `index` and calls itself with `index + 1` and the same `length`.
- This ensures that all possible combinations are generated by branching into "include" and "exclude" scenarios.

->Unique Combinations with Set
- The `set<string>` ensures that combinations are unique across all input strings.
- If a combination is not in `uniqueCombinations`, it is added to both the set and the current list of combinations.

->Summary
- This code effectively generates all unique combinations from a set of input strings for lengths between 1 and 4.
- The recursive function ensures that every possible combination is generated.
- Using a `set` to track unique combinations prevents duplicates.
- The code outputs all unique combinations to an output file.
