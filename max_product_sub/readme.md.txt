The provided C++ code defines a function f and a main function. The f function takes a vector of long long integers as input and calculates the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within that vector. The algorithm iterates through the input array, maintaining three variables: cmps (maximum positive product ending at the current position), cmi (minimum negative product ending at the current position), and mp (maximum product found so far). At each iteration, cmps and cmi are updated by considering the maximum and minimum products that can be obtained by extending the current subarray with the current element. The mp variable keeps track of the maximum product found throughout the iterations. Finally, the function returns the maximum product modulo 1e9 + 7. The main function reads the input, constructs the input vector, calls the f function, and prints the result. Overall, the algorithm efficiently computes the maximum product of a contiguous subarray within the given vector by dynamically updating the maximum and minimum products at each step.
