Algorithm Description
The provided code implements a recursive algorithm to find the number of ways to represent a given amount (am) using a set of coins. The coins are represented by the vector v, and the function func calculates the number of ways to make change for the given amount using these coins.

The algorithm uses memoization to optimize repeated calculations and improve efficiency. The memoization table is implemented with the array dp.

Code Explanation
The func function takes the amount to be changed (am) and a vector of coin denominations (v) as parameters.

If the amount to be changed is 0, the function returns 1, indicating that there is one way to make change (no coins need to be used).

Memoization: The function checks if the result for the current amount (am) is already stored in the memoization table (dp). If so, it returns the precomputed result.

The function then iterates through each coin denomination in the vector v and recursively calls itself with the reduced amount (am - v[i]).

The total number of ways to make change for the given amount is the sum of the results obtained from recursive calls for all possible coin denominations.

The result is stored in the memoization table for future use, and the result is returned.

The solve function reads the input amount (am), initializes the coin vector (v), sets up memoization, and prints the result.
