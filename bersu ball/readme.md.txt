
The provided C++ code appears to be solving a problem related to comparing two arrays of integers. Here's an algorithmic explanation of what the code does:

Input Handling: The program takes two inputs, n and m, representing the sizes of two arrays.

Array Input: It reads n integers into the array tab[] and m integers into the array tab2[].

Sorting: Both arrays tab[] and tab2[] are sorted in non-decreasing order using the sort function from the Standard Template Library (STL).

Comparison Loop: The program iterates over each element in the first array tab[]. For each element tab[i]:

It initializes a pointer wsk to 0.
It then iterates over the elements of the second array tab2[] while wsk is less than m and the value at tab2[wsk] is less than tab[i] - 1.
Within this loop, it checks if tab2[wsk] falls within the range of tab[i] - 1 and tab[i] + 1.
If the condition is met, it increments the counter wyn and moves the pointer wsk to the next element in tab2[].
Finally, it increments wyn by 1 if a match is found.
Output: The program prints the final count wyn, representing the number of elements in tab[] that have corresponding elements in tab2[] within a range of ±1.

In summary, the algorithm compares two sorted arrays and counts the number of elements in the first array that have corresponding elements in the second array within a range of ±1. This is achieved by iterating through both arrays simultaneously and using a pointer to keep track of the position in the second array.
